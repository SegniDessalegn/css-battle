# css-battle
A small css battle to implement the design of a given picture.

# My approach
We can use flex boxes to implement the design. First we need to align three divs in a horizontal flex. Each of the divs have two child divs which are again aligned using vertical flex. Then depending on their position, we can color and give border radius to one of the child divs.
